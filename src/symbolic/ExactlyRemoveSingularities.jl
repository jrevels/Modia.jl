    module ExactlyRemoveSingularities - exactly remove singularities from A*v = 0 with A an Integer matrix.

Use this module in the following way:

   using ExactlyRemoveSingularities
   result = removeSingularities(A,ix,iy)    # result = (iya, eqr, ix1, ix2, eqx, A1, A2)
   printRemoveSingularities(A,result,names)

where A is a dense or sparse Int matrix A[:,:] describing a linear system

    A*v = 0

with

  - v[ix]: Variables used in the derivative operator, der(v[ix]), so these are the potential states.

  - v[iy]: Variables that must be solved from ```A*v = 0```, because these variables do not appear in the remaining part of the model equations (e.g. absolute potentials). If variables v[iy] cannot be uniquely solved from ```A*v = 0```, then in argument iya the variables are listed that must be set arbitrarily so that v[iy] can be uniquely solved from the equations. For example, if v[iy] contains the absolute potentials and no ground object is present, then v[iya] are the absolute potentials that must be explicitly set, e.g., by introducing an equation v[iya]=0, in order that the equations have a unique solution. Additionally, a warning message should be printed that v[iya] was set to 0.)

The function return arguments are all of type Int and have the following meaning:

  - iya: variables v[iya] can be arbitrarily set (iya is a sub-set of iy)

  - eqr: equations ```A[eqr,:]*v = 0``` are redundant and should be removed (they do not change the result)

  - ix1: x[ix1] are the dependent states (ix1 is a sub-set of ix)

  - ix2: i[ix2] are the independent states (ix2 is a sub-set of ix)

  - eqx, A1, A2: equations ```A[eqx,:]*v = 0``` should be replaced by the equations ```A1*x1 + A2*x2 = 0```, where A1 is square, upper triangular and has full rank with A1[i,i] != 0. In other words, x1 can be computed explicitely from these equations given x2.

The calling program should do the following:

   - Remove equations ```A[eqr,:]*v = 0```, because these are redundant equations.
   - Replace equations ```A[eqx,:]*v = 0``` by ```A1*x1 + A2*x2 = 0```, in order that index reduction can be performed by a structural algorithm (e.g. Pantelides algorithm).
   - Introduce equations v[iya] = 0 and print a warning message that these variables have been arbitrarily set to zero. This is needed, in order that the equations have a unique solution.

    (Afac, rk, p1, p2, Bfac) = upperTrapezoidal(A,B)
    (Afac, rk, p1, p2)       = upperTrapezoidal(A)

A and B are **Int** matrices with dimensions A[n1,n2], B[n1,:] or B[n1], so B can be a matrix or a vector. Furthermore A and B can be dense or sparse matrices (SparseMatrixCSC). If B is not present, it is interpreted
as zero matrix. Typically A has more columns as rows (n2 > n1). The function transforms the equation

    A*X = B

to

    Afac*X[p2,:] = Bfac

with

- Afac an **upper trapezoidal** Int matrix with Afac[i,i] != 0 for i<=rk; Afac[rk+1:end,:] = 0

- Bfac an Int matrix or vector (not present if B is not present)

- rk the rank of A and of Afac

- p1 the row permutation vector of A

- p2 the column permutation vector of A

The transformation is performed by a fraction-free Gauss elimination with
exact (integer) computation. It is then possible to solve for X by splitting
X[p2,:] = [X1;X2] with X1[rk,rk], providing any values for X2 and computing X1 from

    Afac[1:rk,1:rk]*X1 = Bfac[1:rk,:] - Afac[1:rk,rk+1:end]*X2

Since Afac[1:rk,1:rk] is **upper triangular** with non-zeros on the diagonal,
this is just a forward recursion. Note, the (full) pivoting is performed
in such a way that it is tried to utilize the **upper** part of X in X1.
Therefore, variables that must be solved for should be in the upper part of X.

The permutation vector p1 can be used to determine the equations in A and B that
can be removed without changing the result (provided Bfac[rk+1:end,:] = 0):

    p1red = p1[rg+1:end]
    A[p1red,:]*X = B[p1red,:] are redundant equations that can be removed
